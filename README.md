# MSGR
MSGR Timer

Program is run through the cmd line and takes two arguments.

- File to be processed
- desired name for output file


example usage:

`msgr dtest.txt output.txt`

There is a `timefile.msgr` provided this allows the manipulation & update of the various machines
each part goes through all values are in seconds.
There are current 35 processes accounted for that each part can go through the position of which each in the timefile is
labled within it.

More parts may be added to the time file in the future simply copy and paste at the bottom and update the times if new machines are being added then the
source needs to be updated to account for them, but only if machines are being added as many dwl codes as are needed can be added and checked against the current
list of machine times.
